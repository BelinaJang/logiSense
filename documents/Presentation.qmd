# Introduction & Motivation

The general logistic regression formula is:

$$
\text{logit}(p) = \ln\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \dots + \beta_kX_k
$$

. . .

Where:

. . .

-   $p$ is the probability of the outcome occurring.
-   $\text{logit}(p)$ is the log-odds of the probability.
-   $\beta\_0$ is the intercept.
-   $\beta\_1, \beta\_2, \dots, \beta\_k$ are the coefficients of the predictor variables $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_k$.
-   $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_k$ are the predictor variables.

. . .

# Introduction

- Essential for evaluating the strength of associations between binary outcomes and independent variables (categorical, continuous)



# Motivation

- Challenging to interpret because they are in the <b> log-odds </b> scale

. . .

- Conducted a literature review and found a letter by Rajeev Kumar Malhotra that highlighted critical errors in interpreting the results of logistic regression

. . .

- Several occurrences of the misinterpretation of odds ratios (OR)


<ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 40px;">
  <li style="text-indent: -15px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
    &#8594; Treated ORs as direct probabilities or relative risk (RR)
  </li>
  <li style="text-indent: -15px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
    <li style="text-indent: -15px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
    &#8594; Can lead to exaggerated conclusions about the strength of associations, particularly for common outcomes
</ul>

# Odds Ratio Misinterpreted as Relative Risk: Rampure et al. (2019)

- Authors examined a common outcome of alcohol relapse (prevalence = 55.4\%)

Misinterpretation:

> "People with a high level of craving have 1.8 times the chance of relapse compared to low craving."

The statement misinterpreted the OR (1.78, 95% CI: 1.25-2.54) as the RR.



Correct interpretation:

> “The odds of relapse among people with a high level of craving are 1.8 times greater than the odds of relapse among those with a low level of craving.”
